## YouTube Data Collection and Analysis

I've collected data about the trending videos on YouTube to analyze and find what makes a video trend on YouTube.

For data collection first, I used an API from Google Cloud Console.

The histograms show that the distributions of view counts, like counts, and comment counts are right-skewed, with most videos having lower counts and a few videos having very high counts.

The heatmap confirms strong positive correlations between views, likes, and comments.

The bar chart shows that the Gaming, Entertainment, Sports, and Music categories have the highest number of trending videos.

Music and People & Blogs categories have the highest average view counts, likes, and comments. Film & Animation also shows high engagement, especially in view counts and like counts.

The scatter plot shows a slight negative correlation between video length and view count, indicating shorter videos tend to have higher view counts. Videos in the 0-5 minute range have the highest average view counts, likes, and comments. Engagement decreases as video length increases.

The scatter plot shows a very weak relationship between the number of tags and view count, suggesting that the number of tags has minimal impact on a video’s view count.

The distribution shows that most videos are published between 14:00 and 20:00 hours (2 PM – 8 PM), indicating this may be an optimal time for uploading videos. There is a very weak negative relationship between publish hour and view count, suggesting that the hour of publication has minimal impact on engagement metrics.

## Conclusion
 My conclusion based on the data, for a vid to trend on YouTube:

1. Encourage viewers to like and comment on videos to boost engagement metrics.
   
2. Aim to create shorter videos (under 5 minutes) for higher engagement, especially for categories like Music and Entertainment.
   
3. Schedule video uploads around peak times (2 PM – 8 PM) to maximize initial views and engagement.
